RockOn is a music player for Android. It has a nice all-graphic UI interface making it the player of choice if you prefer browsing your music library by album art. The main features are:

  * Cool album art navigation UI
  * Location-aware concert info of your library's artists (uses Last.FM API).
  * One of the most effective album art fetchers we know (uses Last.FM API + Google Image Search).
